# Consignment Shop Demo
This project is based on Tim Corey's Consignment Shop Demo video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxewTI4H2mY

This project starts with the Consignment Shop Demo project presented in the above Tim Corey Video.

I am currently seeking employment as a developer.
This project shows my ability to understand, work with, and implement the following:

Work with and extend an existing project.

C#

Winforms

SQL Server

Dapper

Seperate Core logic from the UI into a library

Use NuGet packages

The original video created a small demo application with a single form with hardcoded sample items and vendors. This project shows my ability to work with and extend an existing codebase. It demonstrates that I am able to work with SQL Server, stored procedures and Dapper.

Please feel free to contact me if interested in talking about this project, C#, or employment oppertunities. Thanks for reading!
